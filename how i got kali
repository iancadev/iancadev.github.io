So, I tried installing Kali onto an external hard drive using a live image running in Virtual Box
In order to get Virtual Box to mount the hard drive, I needed to format it in disk management

Once I installed it, I tried booting it on the laptop. My Levovo laptop had a graphical bios, so when I
tried booting it, it just frustratingly reloaded the boot setup page, no error displayed.
Booting on a DELL desktop: it just showed some booting error.

I tried setting up a Bodhi live image on the drive using unetbootin, and it wouldn't boot on the DELL
(same error), but it would boot on a Thinkcenter m93p...

I tried installing Kali using a LiveUSB (made with Rufus) onto the drive, but the first issue I encountered
was actually 1. Kali not detecting the installation media (I had to unplug and plug back in the LiveUSB), and
2. Kali not being able to verify the integrity of the installation media (I had to use the netinstaller instead).

Once I did all that, I tried booting my Kali installation from the external drive and all I got was a blinking
cursor instantly after booting. I tried messing with my BIOS settings (AHCI vs IDE, UEFI vs Legacy, boot order),
but no changes.

I loaded Zorin Lite 16.3 onto the LiveUSB to mount the drive and remove the "quiet" setting on the drive.

When I rebooted, there was still no change.

I tried installing Zorin as a dual-boot alongside Kali, but same issue.

I then tried installing Zorin as the only OS on the drive, and it actually worked and booted up fine.

So now I tried installing Kali as a dual-boot alongside Zorin. To try fixing some issues, I used dd instead of
iso to set-up the LiveUSB with the 4GB live image instead of installer, which did resolve all the issues with the
installation media. I resized the Zorin partition in Kali live and installed using the rest of the free space
in the installer, and it worked. I can boot from Kali now...

because for some reason grub was being bypassed completely by Zorin...
